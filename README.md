# AetherSense

> **AI-Powered Research Novelty & Literature Intelligence Platform**

AetherSense is an end-to-end AI system that helps researchers evaluate the novelty of academic work using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic similarity search, literature-grounded reasoning, and Large Language Models.

Upload a research paper and receive a comprehensive novelty report containing summaries, related literature, similarity rankings, contributions, research gaps, future research directions, and an estimated novelty score.

## 🚀 Features

### 📄 Research Paper Analysis

* Upload academic research papers in PDF format.
* Automatic extraction of title, abstract, and conclusion.
* Persistent storage of parsed papers for downstream analysis.

### 🔍 Literature Discovery

* Retrieval of related academic papers using OpenAlex.
* LLM-assisted query reformulation for improved literature search.
* Similarity-based ranking of retrieved works.

### 🧠 Literature-Grounded Novelty Analysis

Generate structured reports containing:

* Executive summaries
* Key contributions
* Research gaps
* Future research suggestions
* Novelty scores informed by retrieved literature

### 📊 Similarity Ranking

* Embedding-based similarity computation.
* Cosine similarity ranking.
* Identification of closely related work.

### 📑 Unified Research Reports

Single endpoint providing:

* Paper metadata
* Retrieval metadata
* Similar papers
* Novelty analysis
